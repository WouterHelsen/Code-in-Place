"""
ROULETTE :
In my final project I want to create a program that allows a person to play multiple games of the popular casino game ROULETTE.
The goal is to use a little bit of every subject we learned during Code In Place :
+ A random generator to simulate the roulette wheel.
+ Lists for the outcome of the roulette wheel.
+ A dictionary keeps tracks of the different bets (keys) and their betting size (value).
+ Control flow & plenty of functions
+ Images : I added an image of the Roulette table for people who have no experience with the game.
+ Data Science : I visualize the player's game history on a plot with matplotlib.
